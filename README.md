## Day 3 Homework

* Store the flicks in an array, as well as in the DOM

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Add a promote/fav button, just like you did yesterday
* Add a delete button, just like yesterday
* Add buttons to move a flick up and down a list

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Persist the flicks data using window.localstorage. The flicks should stay in the list even when the page is refreshed.

## Day 4 Homework

* Fix issue with flick id values, which sometimes results in removing the wrong flick from the array (and thus from localStorage)

### Bonus Credit

* Also track the year the flick was released (make sure its still there when you load the page)

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Edit the names of flicks already in list (and make sure changes persist across page loads) Make that span's _content editable_ somehow
* Edit year toooooooooooo <--------

### Super Mega Bonus Credit Hyper Fighting

* Have a good weekend

## Day 5 Homework

* Update with Dave's code (edit stuff)

Categorize stuff! Separate flicks into genres, or separate movies from TV shows! Make a whole new thing with categories, like messages separated into channels! Use your tremendous creativity! Exclamation point!

Or heck, just make separate lists based on the second input field you added in the weekend homework!

### Super Mega Bonus Credit

Add a search field, and only show the results that match the search criteria. Here are some things you may wish to use while implementing search:

*Array.prototype.find() (very similar to findIndex())
*HTMLElement.dataset (remember those IDs we stored?)
*display: none (Heck, you could add a class that includes this rule, and add and move that class from elements you wish to hide.)
